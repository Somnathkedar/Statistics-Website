  <h2>What is Regression Analysis?</h2>
  <p>
    Regression analysis is a statistical method used to understand the relationship
    between variables. It helps us see how one variable changes when another variable changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    In simple words, regression answers questions like:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Does age affect blood pressure?</li>
    <li>Does more study time improve marks?</li>
    <li>Does work experience increase salary?</li>
    <li>Does medicine dosage reduce disease severity?</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Why Do We Need Regression?</h2>
  <p>
    In real life, many factors affect an outcome at the same time.
    Regression helps us separate these effects and understand which factors matter the most.
  </p>
  <p>
    Without regression, we can only guess. With regression, we use data to support decisions.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Dependent and Independent Variables</h2>
  <p>
    Every regression analysis has two main parts:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Dependent Variable (Outcome):</strong> What we want to predict or explain</li>
    <li><strong>Independent Variable (Predictor):</strong> What influences the outcome</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dependent variable: Blood Pressure</li>
    <li>Independent variable: Age</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Real-Life Example 1: Age and Blood Pressure</h2>
  <p>
    As people grow older, their blood pressure usually increases.
    Regression helps us measure how much blood pressure increases with age.
  </p>
  <p>
    If regression shows that blood pressure increases by 0.8 mmHg per year,
    doctors can use this information for early prevention.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Simple Linear Regression</h2>
  <p>
    Simple linear regression studies the relationship between:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>One independent variable</li>
    <li>One dependent variable</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    It is represented using a straight line:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Y = β₀ + β₁X</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Where:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Y = dependent variable</li>
    <li>X = independent variable</li>
    <li>β₀ = intercept</li>
    <li>β₁ = slope</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Interpretation in Simple Language</h2>
  <p>
    If regression shows:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Salary = 15,000 + 2,000 × Experience</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    It means:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Base salary is ₹15,000</li>
    <li>For every additional year of experience, salary increases by ₹2,000</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Real-Life Example 2: Study Hours and Exam Marks</h2>
  <p>
    Students often ask whether studying more really improves marks.
    Regression can answer this clearly.
  </p>
  <p>
    If regression shows that each extra hour of study increases marks by 5 points,
    students can plan their study time better.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Multiple Regression</h2>
  <p>
    In real life, one factor is rarely enough.
    Multiple regression studies the effect of many variables together.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <p>
    Blood Pressure = Age + Weight + Salt Intake + Physical Activity
  </p>

  <p>
    This helps doctors understand which factor contributes more to high blood pressure.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Why Multiple Regression is Powerful</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Adjusts for confounding factors</li>
    <li>Gives more accurate results</li>
    <li>Used in medical and social research</li>
    <li>Helps in policy making</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Regression vs Correlation</h2>
  <p>
    Correlation only tells us whether two variables move together.
    Regression explains how one variable affects another.
  </p>
  <p>
    Regression is used for prediction and decision-making,
    while correlation is used only for association.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Logistic Regression</h2>
  <p>
    When the outcome is Yes or No, logistic regression is used.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hypertension: Yes / No</li>
    <li>Disease: Present / Absent</li>
    <li>Pass / Fail</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Logistic regression predicts probability instead of a direct value.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Real-Life Example 3: Risk of Hypertension</h2>
  <p>
    Logistic regression can estimate the probability that a person has hypertension
    based on age, weight, and lifestyle.
  </p>
  <p>
    This helps in early diagnosis and preventive healthcare.
  </p>

  <h2>Applications of Regression Analysis</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Medical research</li>
    <li>Economics and finance</li>
    <li>Education planning</li>
    <li>Marketing and sales prediction</li>
    <li>Machine learning models</li>
  </ul>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Why Regression is Important for Students</h2>
  <p>
    Regression is one of the most commonly used statistical tools.
    Understanding it opens doors to careers in:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Biostatistics</li>
    <li>Data Science</li>
    <li>Analytics</li>
    <li>Research</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Regression analysis is a powerful and practical statistical method.
    It helps us understand relationships, make predictions, and take informed decisions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether in healthcare, education, business, or daily life,
    regression turns data into meaningful insights.
