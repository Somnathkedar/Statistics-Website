    <h2>What is Biostatistics?</h2>
    <p>
      Biostatistics applies statistical methods to biology, medicine,
      and public health research. It helps analyze medical data
      and supports evidence-based decisions.

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Role of Biostatistics</h2>
    <p>
      Biostatistics helps design experiments, analyze medical data,
      evaluate treatments, and improve healthcare outcomes.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Clinical Trials</h2>
    <p>
      Clinical trials test new drugs and treatments.
      Biostatisticians analyze trial data to ensure safety and effectiveness.

    <h2>Career Opportunities</h2>
    <p>
      Biostatistics offers careers such as biostatistician,
      clinical data analyst, and research analyst.

  <h2>🧬 Biostatistician Interview Questions for Freshers</h2>
  <p>
    This section covers commonly asked interview questions for
    <strong>entry-level / fresher biostatistician roles</strong>,
    focusing on statistics, clinical trials, and real-world applications.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- CORE STATISTICS -->
<section class="card">
  <h3>1️⃣ Core Biostatistics & Statistics</h3>

  <p><strong>Q: Difference between descriptive and inferential statistics?</strong><br>
  Descriptive statistics summarize data using measures like mean, median, and graphs,
  while inferential statistics draw conclusions about a population using sample data.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: Mean, median, mode – when is median preferred?</strong><br>
  Median is preferred when data are skewed or contain outliers.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: Standard deviation vs variance</strong><br>
  Variance measures average squared deviation, while standard deviation is its square root
  and easier to interpret.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: What is a p-value?</strong><br>
  A p-value is the probability of observing the data assuming the null hypothesis is true.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: Type I and Type II error</strong><br>
  Type I error is rejecting a true null hypothesis (false positive).
  Type II error is failing to reject a false null hypothesis (false negative).</p>
</section>

<!-- CLINICAL TRIALS -->
<section class="card">
  <h3>2️⃣ Clinical Trials & Research Concepts</h3>

  <p><strong>Q: Phases of clinical trials</strong><br>
  Phase I assesses safety, Phase II evaluates efficacy,
  Phase III confirms effectiveness, and Phase IV monitors post-marketing safety.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: What is randomization?</strong><br>
  Randomization assigns participants to treatment groups by chance to reduce bias.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: Why is blinding important?</strong><br>
  Blinding prevents expectations from influencing results and reduces assessment bias.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: What is ITT analysis?</strong><br>
  Intention-to-treat analysis includes all randomized subjects regardless of protocol deviations.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: What is a primary endpoint?</strong><br>
  The primary endpoint answers the main research question of the study.</p>
</section>

<!-- STATISTICAL MODELS -->
<section class="card">
  <h3>3️⃣ Statistical Tests & Models</h3>

  <p><strong>Q: Linear vs logistic regression</strong><br>
  Linear regression is used for continuous outcomes, while logistic regression is used for binary outcomes.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: Correlation vs regression</strong><br>
  Correlation measures association, regression models relationships and predicts outcomes.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: Survival analysis</strong><br>
  Survival analysis handles time-to-event data such as time to death or relapse.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: Kaplan–Meier curve</strong><br>
  A Kaplan–Meier curve estimates survival probability over time.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: Hazard ratio</strong><br>
  Hazard ratio compares the risk of an event between two groups.</p>
</section>

<!-- SOFTWARE -->
<section class="card">
  <h3>4️⃣ SAS / R / Statistical Software</h3>

  <p><strong>Q: DATA step vs PROC step in SAS</strong><br>
  DATA step is used for data manipulation, PROC step is used for analysis.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: PROC REG vs PROC LOGISTIC</strong><br>
  PROC REG performs linear regression, PROC LOGISTIC performs logistic regression.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: What are TLFs?</strong><br>
  Tables, Listings, and Figures summarize clinical trial results.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: What is CDISC?</strong><br>
  CDISC standards like SDTM and ADaM ensure standardized clinical trial data.</p>
</section>

<!-- REAL WORLD -->
<section class="card">
  <h3>5️⃣ Real-World & Scenario-Based</h3>

  <p><strong>Q: How do you choose a statistical test?</strong><br>
  I consider study design, variable type, and data distribution.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: How do you handle missing data?</strong><br>
  I first understand why data is missing, then apply appropriate imputation or analysis methods.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: How do you explain results to non-statisticians?</strong><br>
  I use simple language, visuals, and focus on practical meaning.</p>
</section>

<!-- FRESHER QUESTIONS -->
<section class="card">
  <h3>6️⃣ Fresher / Entry-Level Questions</h3>

  <p><strong>Q: Why do you want to be a biostatistician?</strong><br>
  I enjoy applying statistics to improve healthcare decisions.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: Relevant subjects studied</strong><br>
  Biostatistics, clinical trials, regression, survival analysis.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: Why should we hire you?</strong><br>
  I have strong statistical fundamentals, practical understanding,
  and a strong learning mindset.</p>
