      Hypothesis testing is used to make decisions using sample data.
      It helps determine whether an assumption is true or not.
    </p>

    <h2>Null and Alternative Hypothesis</h2>
    <p>
      The null hypothesis assumes no effect.
      The alternative hypothesis assumes there is an effect.
    </p>

    <h2>p-Value</h2>
    <p>
      If p-value is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected.
      Otherwise, it is not rejected.
    </p>

    <h2>Common Tests</h2>
    <p>
      t-test, z-test, chi-square test, and ANOVA are commonly used tests.
