  <h2>What is Probability?</h2>
  <p>
    Probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with uncertainty.
    It helps us measure how likely an event is to happen.
  </p>
  <p>
    In daily life, we often say things like:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>There is a high chance of rain today</li>
    <li>I might pass the exam</li>
    <li>This medicine usually works</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Probability converts these statements into numbers.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Range of Probability</h2>
  <p>
    Probability always lies between <strong>0 and 1</strong>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>0 means the event is impossible</li>
    <li>1 means the event is certain</li>
    <li>Values between 0 and 1 show uncertainty</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Basic Probability Formula</h2>
  <p>
    The basic formula of probability is:
  </p>
  <p><strong>
    Probability = Number of favourable outcomes ÷ Total number of outcomes
  </strong></p>
  <p>
    This formula is used when all outcomes are equally likely.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Real-Life Example: Tossing a Coin</h2>
  <p>
    When we toss a fair coin, there are two possible outcomes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Head</li>
    <li>Tail</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Probability of getting a Head:
  </p>
  <p><strong>1 ÷ 2 = 0.5</strong></p>
  <p>
    This means there is a 50% chance of getting a Head.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Important Probability Terms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Experiment:</strong> An action with uncertain result (tossing a coin)</li>
    <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> A possible result (Head)</li>
    <li><strong>Sample Space:</strong> All possible outcomes</li>
    <li><strong>Event:</strong> One or more outcomes</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Sample Space Explained</h2>
  <p>
    Sample space is the collection of all possible outcomes.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <p>
    Tossing a die:
  </p>
  <p>
    Sample space = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Types of Events</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Impossible event:</strong> Probability = 0</li>
    <li><strong>Certain event:</strong> Probability = 1</li>
    <li><strong>Simple event:</strong> Single outcome</li>
    <li><strong>Compound event:</strong> More than one outcome</li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h2>Real-Life Example: Exam Results</h2>
  <p>
    Suppose a student studies regularly.
    The probability of passing the exam increases.
  </p>
  <p>
    Probability helps teachers and students understand performance trends.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Classical Probability</h2>
  <p>
    Classical probability is used when outcomes are equally likely.
  </p>
  <p>
    Examples include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Coins</li>
    <li>Dice</li>
    <li>Cards</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Empirical (Experimental) Probability</h2>
  <p>
    Empirical probability is based on actual experiments or past data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Example:
  </p>
  <p>
    If it rained 20 days out of 100 days, then:
  </p>
  <p><strong>
    Probability of rain = 20 ÷ 100 = 0.2
  </strong></p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Subjective Probability</h2>
  <p>
    Subjective probability is based on personal judgement or experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    Example:
  </p>
  <p>
    A doctor may say there is a high chance of recovery based on experience.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Probability Rules</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Probability of an event is always between 0 and 1</li>
    <li>Sum of probabilities of all outcomes = 1</li>
    <li>Probability of impossible event = 0</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Addition Rule of Probability</h2>
  <p>
    Used when finding probability of either event A or event B.
  </p>
  <p><strong>
    P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A and B)
  </strong></p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Multiplication Rule of Probability</h2>
  <p>
    Used when finding probability of both events happening together.
  </p>
  <p><strong>
    P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B)
  </strong></p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Conditional Probability</h2>
  <p>
    Conditional probability is the probability of an event happening
    given that another event has already occurred.
  </p>
  <p><strong>
    P(A|B) = P(A and B) ÷ P(B)
  </strong></p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Real-Life Example: Medical Testing</h2>
  <p>
    Probability is widely used in medical diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>
    Doctors use probability to understand:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Chance of disease</li>
    <li>Accuracy of test results</li>
    <li>Risk of complications</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Probability Distributions</h2>
  <p>
    Probability distributions describe how probabilities are distributed
    across different outcomes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Common distributions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Binomial distribution</li>
    <li>Normal distribution</li>
    <li>Poisson distribution</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Why Probability is Important</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Used in statistics and data science</li>
    <li>Helps in decision making</li>
    <li>Used in weather forecasting</li>
    <li>Important in medical research</li>
    <li>Foundation of machine learning</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Probability in Daily Life</h2>
  <p>
    Probability helps us understand risks and make better choices.
  </p>
  <p>
    From deciding whether to carry an umbrella
    to choosing an investment,
    probability plays a silent but important role.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Probability is the language of uncertainty.
    It allows us to express unknown outcomes using numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
    A strong understanding of probability builds the foundation
    for statistics, regression analysis, and data science.
